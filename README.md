# numerical-methods
A repository of numerical methods meant for educational purposes. I am prioritizing simple and readable implementations that will (hopefully) benefit students. Ideally you will use this code as a starting point and then improve it youself.


## ODE Solvers
- Euler's Method
- Runge-Kutta (4th Order)

## Root Finding
- Newton's Method

## Linear Algebra

## Optimization
